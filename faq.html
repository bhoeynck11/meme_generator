                <h4>#1 - What in the world is this website?</h4>
                <p>Memes are taking over the world. It's hard to get too far down your Facebook or Twitter feed without seeing 2 or 3 memes about dogs, politicians, sports stars, or babies. Now, you can join in on the fun and make a meme about literally anything you want. Literally. Anything.</p>

                <h4>#2 - How does it all work?</h4>
                <p>It's simple! Just a few basic steps. In a typical meme, there are two captions. One at the top of the photo, and one on the bottom. To change the top caption, simply type some words in the "Upper Caption" form field. To change the bottom caption, type some new words into the "Lower Caption" form field. As you type into these fields, the text will auto-populate on the image. Pretty cool, I know.</p>

                <h4>#3 - Can I change the picture from that cute koala bear?</h4>
                <p>Not sure why you'd want to, but if you really feel the need to, then yes you can. Above the "Upper Caption" and "Lower Caption" form fields, there is a form field labeled "Enter a URL here". There, you can copy and paste a URL from anywhere in the far reaches of the Internet. Once the URL is there, click the "Add" butto, and you've lost the koala bear forever (just kidding, refreshing the page brings him back).</p>

                <h4>#4 - Is there any way to get in touch with you?</h4>
                <p>Of course! I'd love you to! This site is still a work in progress, and I'd definitely appreciate any advice from somebody more experienced. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, click on over to "Contact", where you'll see different ways to contact me. You can fill out the form, or connect with me through Email, LinkedIn, or Facebook.</p>
